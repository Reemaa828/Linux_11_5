## System Call Introduction
  **what is a system call?**

  System call provides the **services** of the linux kernel, in another definition its a **software interrupt**. its also the **interface** provided for us to use a service made available by os.

   **how does it work?**

  When a userland request a service from kernel space, meaning that if a program needs to access a specific resource it has to go thru the kernel first
this service is the system call.

 **Steps**
- invoke a function or a service from the kernel by using glibc 
- save context of userspace 
- context switch from userspace to kernelspace
- search for syscall in [syscall table](https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/)
- do operation
- return result
  | status | return value |
  | --------- | -------- |
  | failure | cause of failure or any value except 0 |
  | success | content or 0 or null |
- restore context of userspace

**Example of System Call**
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[userland] --> |function call that has same name as syscall| B(glibc)
    B --> |syscall interface| C(syscall)
    C --> |syscall implementation function| D[Kernel Land]

```


>[!note]
>glibc is a wrapper library that has wrapper functions, one function of the glibc has many syscalls and if i want to do the direct way to the kernel i have to use all these syscalls. examples of using a glibc and all the syscalls that happen in one of glibc functions

>glibc can be customized to another c standard library like musl
>no file interactions the syscall interacts directly with the kernel
>we can do **monitoring** by using `strace` command and overview using `strace -c` and see the failure of any syscalls
