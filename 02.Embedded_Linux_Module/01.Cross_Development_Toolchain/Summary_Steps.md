# 1. Setting Up the Toolchain

Before diving into cross-compilation, let's ensure you have the necessary prerequisites. Run the following commands to install essential tools:
```bash
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake bison bzip2 cmake flex g++ gawk gcc gettext git gperf help2man libncurses5-dev libstdc++6 libtool libtool-bin make patch python3-dev rsync texinfo unzip wget xz-utils
```

Now, let's clone the crosstool-NG repository, configure, build, and install it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/crosstool-ng/crosstool-ng.git 
cd crosstool-ng 
./bootstrap
 ./configure --prefix=${PWD} 
make 
make install

```
# 2. Finding and Building a Toolchain


## Finding a Toolchain

You can either use a pre-built toolchain or compile your own through crosstool-NG. For the latter, follow these steps:
```bash
bin/ct-ng distclean 
bin/ct-ng list-samples 
bin/ct-ng <choose sample> 
bin/ct-ng menuconfig 
bin/ct-ng build
```


The output path for your toolchain will be ~/x-tools.



## Building a Toolchain


Use crosstool-NG to build a toolchain for Raspberry Pi 3:

`bin/ct-ng build`



# 3. Understanding the Toolchain

The toolchain comprises various components, including static and dynamic libraries. Understanding these components is crucial for effective cross-compilation.


# 4. Cross Compiling Applications

Learn to cross-compile applications for Raspberry Pi 3 using the configured toolchain.
# 5. Best Practices for Workflow Organization

Explore best practices such as using aliases and modifying your `.bashrc` for efficient PATH management.

## Make alias for g++ compiler of RaspberryPi3.

`alias rapsi3-g++=aarch64-rpi3-linux-gnu-g++`

## Don't Forget PATH variable.
