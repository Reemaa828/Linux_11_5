# What's a Toolchain? ü™õ
A set of development tools used with source code or binaries generated from source code. It's used in number of operations:
- compilation
- preparing libraries
- reading binaries
- debugging
it normally contains these tools:
1. **compiler**: generate object files from source code.
2. **linker**: link object files together to build executable.
3. **library archiver**: to group a set of object files to a library file.
4. **debugger**: to debug the binary file while running.
Most popular toolchain is the **GNU toolchain** which is part of GNU project.

# Machines involved üé∞
- **Config machine:** the machine configuring the toolchain components.
- **Build machine**: the machine building the toolchain components.
- **Host machine**: the machine running the toolchain.
- **Target**: the machine running the program that toolchain generated.
We can most of the time assume that the config machine and the build machine are the same.
# Types of Toolchain
1. **Native Toolchain:** build == host == target (**‚Äúnative‚Äù**)
3. **Cross-platform Toolchain:** build == host != target (**‚Äúcross‚Äù**)
4. **Cross-Native Toolchain**: build != host == target (**‚Äúcross-native‚Äù**)
5. **Canadian Toolchain**: build != host != target (**‚Äúcanadian‚Äù**)

## 1. GCC: GNU Compiler Collection
The **compiler** is software that converts a program written in a high-level language (Source Language) to a low-level language (Object/Target/Machine Language/0, 1‚Äôs).

use `g++ <file_name>` to perform the compilation process and get executable

use `g++ <file_name> -o reema` to get output with a different naming

use `g++ -save-temps <file_name>` to get all the files on every stage of the compilation process

use `g++ -E <file_name>` to stop at preprocessing stage

use `g++ -S <file_name>` to stop at compilation stage

use `g++ -c <file_name>` to  stop at assembler stage

use `g++ <file_name> -I<header_files_path>` so it can look for header files in these directories

use `g++ -Wall <file_name>` to show all warnings 
use `g++ -Werror <file_name>` to make a warning into an error
use `g++ <file_name> @option_file` file for all options you want to use


## Stages of compilation process

## What's an object file
Relocatable object file is in elf format. it contains info such as **symbol table** that will be needed in the linking process.
## What's a symbol table
A symbol table is a crucial data structure used by compilers and linkers to store information about identifiers (variables, functions, etc.) used in a program and if it's needed or provided in that file.
**Key information stored in a symbol table:**
- **Identifier name:** The actual name of the variable or function.
- **Data type:** The type of the variable (int, float, char, etc.) or the return type of a function.
- **Memory address:** The location of the variable or function in memory (if known).

## Linking process
**Linking** is the process of combining multiple object files (generated by the compiler) and libraries into a single executable file.

use `ld command` to link object files together
