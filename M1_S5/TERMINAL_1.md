# What's a Shell? üêö
A shell is an abstract name for a scripting language, there's three types 
1. bash.
2. Zsh.
3. PowerShell.

# Environment Variable Commandsüëæ
-  use `env` to load environment variables.
- use `echo $$` to get process id of shell.
- use `ps -aux | grep "terminal"` to get process id of terminal.
- use `$Var=<value>` to change value of environment variable.
- use `Var=<value>` to create a new environment variable *locally*.
- use `export Var=<value>` to  create a new environment variable *globally*.
- use `unset Var` to delete environment variable.
- use `echo $SHELL` to know the type of shell.

# What makes environment variable permanent?‚ôæÔ∏è
if we used `export var=<value>` it will disappear once i close the session, if we want to make it permanent do these steps:
1. make a new env. variable

# What's difference between source and a normal run?
source: it loads all the file content into parent process (terminal).
